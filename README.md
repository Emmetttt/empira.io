# ~~TFS 1.5 Nekiro's Downgrades~~
## Due to lack of time, will and funding, project is discontinued.

This repository holds three TFS 1.5 downgrades.

Keep in mind these downgrades are protocol downgrades.
What it means? It means that it's not fully featured server.
It's a nice base to start working on in desired protocol version.
Datapack is not included.
